# 2022 Atmospheric Environmental Remote Sensing Summer School
The Summer School is an annual training course organized by Atmospheric Environmental Remote Sensing Society (AERSS). The Society is an international scientific non-profit organization which will be formally recognized in mid-July 2022. AERSS is dedicated to building an interdisciplinary and cross-country platform for linking remote sensing to modeling and in situ observations, and promoting the application of atmospheric environmental remote sensing in climate, air quality, and other sustainable development goals (SDGs), especially in the Global South. As the inaugural event, the 2022 Summer School will invite senior and emerging scientists to deliver lectures. Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the training courses will be held online over the two-day period from ***July 14-15, 2022***, using ***VooV Meeting***. A wide range of participants is expected including professional researchers, students, faculties, university staff, and policymakers.  

Upon completion, you can ***join AERSS for free*** and get the benefits provided by the Society, including but not limited to resource access permissions, discounts on conference registration fees, and guidance by the experts. AERSS is going to offer a limited number of ***travel grants and registration fee waivers*** to subsidize the travel of the member to attend an academic conference funded by AERSS in 2023. Those who shall have participated in this Summer School could sent ***curriculum vitae and one-page research progress*** to AERSS Secretary-General (Kai Qin, qinkai@cumt.edu.cn) before ***July 31 2022***. Applications will be judged on intellectual merit of the paper topic with a view to disciplinary and regional balances.

    > Abstract: This lecture will present key elements to understand past, present, and expected changes of the Earth’s climate. We will explore how climate is measured and what has been observed over the last century. An extension of these observations in the past is possible with the study of paleoclimate proxies that inform us on many million years. Our understanding of the climate machine is also based on models describing the physics and interactions between atmosphere, land, oceans, and ice sheets. These models can also help us in making projections of how the Earth’s climate will evolve in the future. For the lecture to be the most adapted to your interests, we ask to all participants to fill the short survey at the link below. The questions do not require any investigation from your side, it is even better if you answer just from what you already know (or don't know).  https://form.dragnsurvey.com/survey/r/839d2f29
