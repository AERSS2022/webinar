#### **Juseon Bak**  
*Institute of Environmental Studies, Pusan National University*  
*AERSS WG-3 Pollutant Gases Invited Expert*  
Juseon Bak’s research focuses on the analysis of spectra measured by space-borne spectrometers operating in the ultraviolet and visible in order to measure atmospheric composition. Her current research projects involve the calibration of spectra, wavelength, and instrumental response function, accurate/fast radiative transfer calculations, extension of algorithm physics to simulate the observed spectra, cross-verification between satellite and in-situ measurements, scientific analysis for the remote sensing of trace gases and aerosols. As a result, the ozone profile algorithm she is working on is going to be implemented to reprocess OMI ozone profile product (PROFOZ) in the NASA data center and to be transferred to both GEMS and TEMPO Science Data Processing Center (SDPC). She is pioneering the implementation of Principle Component Analysis (PCA)-based fast radiative transfer calculation to the operational data processing to reduce the computational cost and the combined UV/VIS retrievals to improve the detection of the boundary layer ozone from GOME/2 and TEMPO.
#### **Chi Li**  
*Washington University in St. Louis*  
*AERSS Early Career and Postgraduate Committee Co-Chair*  
Chi Li graduated from Dalhousie University, Canada in Dec 2018, with a PhD in Atmospheric Science. He is currently a postdoc at Washington University. Dr. Li is broadly interested in using various observations and modeling approaches to quantify and investigate atmospheric composition that impacts atmospheric environments. His work involves satellite retrieval of aerosols and nitrogen dioxide, and interpreting remote sensing datasets with chemical transport modeling and machine learning to unveil changes, sources and sinks of aerosols and ozone, and their precursor gases. Dr. Li has received several prestigious recognitions, including the Killam Predoctoral Scholarship and William Leiper Memorial Scholarship at Dalhousie University. He was also selected to the 15th Atmospheric Chemistry Colloquium for Emerging Senior (ACCESS XV).
#### Lei Zhu
*Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)*  
*AERSS WG-3 Pollutant Gases Invited Experts*  
Lei Zhu’s research area is atmospheric chemistry, with special interests in remote sensing of trace gases, modeling of atmospheric species, and data assimilation. He has published more than 40 journal papers, with a total citation of 2100 and an h-index of 21. He is a science team member of OMI, OMPS, TEMPO, and GEMS satellites. Lei was awarded the American Meteorological Society Special Award, NASA William T. Pecora Team Award, and NASA Group Achievement Award. He received a BS from Nankai University, MS from Peking University, and Ph.D. from Harvard University. He worked as a Research Scholar at Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics before joining SUSTech in 2020.
